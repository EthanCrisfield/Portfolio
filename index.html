					<p>My name is Ethan, I'm 24 and this is my first year of IT. It's been 6 years since I finished my VCE so I'm a bit rusty but I hope to get up and running fast! I'm an avid gamer, I was averaging ~80 hours per week before I started studying again, obviously now I don't have so much time but that's not a bad thing!</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="section2">
					<p>My interest in IT sparked when I was around 15, when I really got focused on gaming. I hope to get into the field of game development, software engineering or cyber security. I tried doing IT in highschool but had trouble wrapping my head around it as I had a lot of trouble focusing on school back then.</p>
					<p>I chose to study at RMIT because in year 12 I had a school trip where we went to a bunch of Universities in Melbourne and RMIT was my favourite of all of them! Even the design of the building is appealing to me.</p>
					<p>I hope to gain a solid knowledge of the basics of HTML and Java during my introductory studies, and from there I will apply for a bachelor in IT, to hopefully learn much, much more about game development, software engineering or cyber security.</p>

					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<h5>My MBTI indicates that I'm a "Virtuoso" which states: "A Virtuoso (ISTP) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to have an individualistic mindset, pursuing goals without needing much external connection. They engage in life with inquisitiveness and personal skill, varying their approach as needed."</h5>
					<h3>Strengths</h3>
					<span>Optimistic and Energetic</span>
					<h5>"Virtuosos are usually up to their elbows in some project or other. Cheerful and good-natured, people with the Virtuoso personality type (especially Assertive ones) rarely get stressed out, preferring to go with the flow."</h5>
					<span>Creative and Practical</span>
					<h5>Virtuosos are very imaginative when it comes to practical things, mechanics, and crafts. Novel ideas come easily, and they love using their hands to put them into action.</h5>
					<span>Spontaneous and Rational</span>
					<h5>Combining spontaneity with logic, Virtuosos can switch mindsets to fit new situations with little effort, making them flexible and versatile individuals.</h5>
					<span>Know How to Prioritize</span>
					<h5>This flexibility comes with some unpredictability, but Virtuoso personalities are able to store their spontaneity for a rainy day, releasing their energy just when it’s needed most.</h5>
					<span>Great in a Crisis</span>
					<h5>With all this hands-on creativity and spontaneity, it’s no wonder that Virtuosos are naturals in crisis situations. People with this personality type usually enjoy a little physical risk, and they aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty when the situation calls for it.</h5>
					<span>Relaxed</span>
					<h5>Through all this, Virtuosos are able to stay quite relaxed. They live in the moment and go with the flow, refusing to worry too much about the future.</h5>
					<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
					<span>Stubborn</span>
					<h5>As easily as Virtuosos go with the flow, they can also ignore it entirely, and usually move in another direction with little apology or sensitivity. If someone tries to change Virtuosos’ habits, lifestyle or ideas through criticism, they can become quite blunt in their irritation.</h5>
					<span>Insensitive</span>
					<h5>Virtuosos use logic, and even when they try to meet others halfway with empathy and emotional sensitivity, it rarely seems to quite come out right, if anything is even said at all.</h5>
					<span>Private and Reserved</span>
					<h5>Virtuoso personalities are notoriously difficult to get to know. They are true introverts, keeping their personal matters to themselves, and often just prefer silence to small talk.</h5>
					<span>Easily Bored</span>
					<h5>Virtuosos enjoy novelty, which makes them excellent tinkerers, but much less reliable when it comes to focusing on things long-term. Once something is understood, Virtuosos tend to simply move on to something new and more interesting.</h5>
					<span>Dislike Commitment</span>
					<h5>Long-term commitments are particularly onerous for Virtuosos. They prefer to take things day-by-day, and the feeling of being locked into something for a long time is downright oppressive. This can be a particular challenge in Virtuosos’ romantic relationships.</h5>
					<span>Risky Behavior</span>
					<h5>This stubbornness, difficulty with others’ emotions, focus on the moment, and easy boredom can lead to unnecessary and unhelpful boundary-pushing, just for fun. Virtuosos have been known to escalate conflict and danger just to see where it goes, something that can have disastrous consequences for everyone around if they lose control of the situation.</h5>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="section2">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>My main project idea will be a mobile app focused on safety for the user if they are walking alone at night or in an unsafe area. The app will be able to send location pings and/or call emergency services if the user uses a certain function. The app design would be subtle as to not alert an attacker of the app being in use.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>My partner is my main motivation for this project as she works night shift in the CBD. I know it can be a scary place and you can never know what kind of people are going to be there. I also think about my mother and sister when I think of this app as I know they would appreciate an app like this, just in case of emergencies. I hear more and more stories about women being harassed while they're just trying to walk to their car, or home at night.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>This mobile app, which I would call "WalkSafe" would allow the user to input certain contacts to help them if they were in trouble. It would also allow the user to input a pre-recorded voice message to use for emergency services, or would let them choose to use a premade voice message.<br>It would have a function where if the user presses a certain button, or lets go of a certain button that should be held, then the app would send a location ping to the user-set contacts and phone 000, using a preset voice message that lasts long enough for emergency services to be able to ping the location. The app would also have a brief warning screen in which the user can undo the action if they hit the button accidentally or let go accidentally.<br>The app would be subtle, meaning dark and simple, just so that if the user is attacked, they would be less likely to notice the app being used. The app would also be free and not show ads, as they can be bright and would alert an attacker.<br>I also think it would be cool if the user could activate this remotely if an attacker takes their phone. I'm not sure how I would implement that but it's definitely food for thought.</p>
					<p>Obviously this app wouldn't completely stop an attack from happening but it can at least alert the right people that something has gone wrong. Another reason for the app being free is that people shouldn't have to pay for safety, and I feel like it would be taking advantage of anyone who wanted to feel safe, if the app was a paid app.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>I would need to learn a lot more about Xamarin, which seems to be the most commonly used dev tool for mobile apps, and from what I've read it can develop apps for iOS, Windows and Android devices. This way the user wouldn't need a particular type of phone or device to have access to the app.<br>Xamarin uses .NET and C# for coding so I would need to learn those languages, but I think that would come fairly easily after learning more HTML and Java.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>As stated above I would need to learn a lot more about Xamarin, .NET and C#. I think that as I learn more about HTML, CSS and Java, other programming languages will also become easier, as they all seem to be fairly similar just with different classes and such. I would also need to learn how to code in the location pinging feature and could potentially import certain contacts from the contact list already on the phone or other device.<br>Learning these languages would certainly help with other projects and app developments. I'm really keen to get into it and I think it'll be a really good skill set to have.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>With a successful outcome, people will have access to the "WalkSafe" app on all devices and be able to use it immediately. I think it could drive down crime rates of that type if people knew about it, as it would discourage anyone thinking about doing that if they knew they would be caught. I think the development of this app would impact the community in a positive way and would encourage people to use the app, while discouraging attackers from, well, attacking. Hopefully the app could make people feel even a little bit safer on those walks alone.</p>
